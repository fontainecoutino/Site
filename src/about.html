            Problem-solver and passionate web developer. I have had the privilege
            of contributing to key projects at Pinnacle Aerospace, a leading
            provider of nearshore software development solutions for the aerospace
            industry. From developing cutting-edge interfaces for aircraft ACMS to
            creating web applications for reservation management, I thrive deliver
            high-quality code that meets the highest standards but also exceeds
            expectations.

            My skill set covers languages like Go, Java, and Python, and I'm
            well-versed in technologies such as .NET, Angular, and Docker. I bring
            a dynamic skill set to every web development challenge.I genuinely
            enjoy working with a team and find it incredibly rewarding.
            Collaborating with others allows us to pool our diverse perspectives,
            skills, and experiences to tackle challenges and achieve remarkable
            outcomes. Looking ahead, my goal as a back-end developer is to
            continuously refine my skills and stay at the forefront of emerging
            technologies.
